# Spam Mail Server Lists

The contents of this folder are various spam email server lists I've gathered and created scripts to keep updated once per day and format as IP addresses only, for download/import directly into a block list on my firewall, and Network Ranges, which my firewall can't directly use but is part of future planning and may be useful to others.

Most anti-spam services are a DNS lookup type service, not IP addresses. I figure this aggregation of anti-spam IP address may be of use to others.

I use some or all of these lists to block connections to my mail servers. I should note that my mail servers don't deal in anything critical, so if I end up blocking some valid email servers, then it's not going to be life vs. death or million-dollar-contract vs. eviction.

Use your own judgement, do some research.
