# Spam Mail Server Lists

The contents of this folder are various spam email server lists I've gathered and created scripts to keep updated once per day and format as IP addresses only, for download/import directly into a block list on my firewall, and Network Ranges, which my firewall can't directly use but is part of future planning and may be useful to others.

Most anti-spam services are a DNS lookup type service, not IP addresses. I figure this aggregation of anti-spam IP address may be of use to others.

I use it to block connections to my mail servers, and may extend it to blocking all incoming traffic from these addresses to all services.
