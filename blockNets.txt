# Censys.io - Internet scanner
# ----------------------------
# They make money by probing everyone else's networks and selling what they find.
# No thanks, I don't want my shit to be searchable on their platform.
# They thankfully provide a list of the IP ranges they scan from, here:
# https://support.censys.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043177092-from-faq
# The data also expires after up to 48 hours, so that's at least something.

# ShadowServer.org
# ----------------
# These guys are apparently making the internet safer by scanning the entire internet X times a day.
# Much like the above, profiting from polluting the internet, and selling it to governments and law enforcement.
# Count me out.
# I think the bad guys would be easier to spot if 'good guys' weren't also probing my ports.
# Also, their overt moralising on their website feels to me like either or both of:
# - Methinks the lady doth protest too much
# - Undertones of fascism
# I suspect they're an arm of one intelligence organisation or another. Either way, GTF away from my ports.
# It's also likely they have a lot more IP address ranges than those listed here.

# Rapid7

# Another "internet security" org. Sigh.
# Data for network ranges to block from here:
# - https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications/rapid7 
# - https://opendata.rapid7.com/about/ 
# The first set of IP address ranges is a bunch that they own for various infrastructure, likely including their websites and services:
27.0.224.0/22
38.242.21.0/24
161.38.59.0/24
195.95.191.0/24
199.201.125.0/24
# This second set is where they scan from (so far as I can tell).
# The second link above specifically says:
# "Project Sonar performs its collection activities from AWS EC2 us-west-1, us-west-2 and us-east-1 instances with non-static IP addresses, 
# and as such cannot be readily allowlisted or blocklisted themselves,
# however it is sufficient to blocklist or allowlist the scan ranges listed above"
