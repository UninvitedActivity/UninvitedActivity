# Censys.io - Internet scanner
# ----------------------------
# They make money by probing everyone else's networks and selling what they find.
# No thanks, I don't want my shit to be searchable on their platform.
# They thankfully provide a list of the IP ranges they scan from, here:
# https://support.censys.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043177092-from-faq
# The data also expires after up to 48 hours, so that's at least something.

# ShadowServer.org
# ----------------
# These guys are apparently making the internet safer by scanning the entire internet X times a day.
# Much like the above, profiting from polluting the internet, and selling it to governments and law enforcement.
# Count me out.
# I think the bad guys would be easier to spot if 'good guys' weren't also probing my ports.
# Also, their overt moralising on their website feels to me like either or both of:
# - Methinks the lady doth protest too much
# - Undertones of fascism
# I suspect they're an arm of one intelligence organisation or another. Either way, GTF away from my ports.
# It's also likely they have a lot more IP address ranges than those listed here.
