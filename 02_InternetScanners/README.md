# Internet Scanners

These are organisations that appear to scan multiple ports of a fair swag of the IPv4 range.

Most of them have websites that say they provide legit security knowledge and data to governments, researchers, and other organisations. Most of them won't even give you a reacharound (censys.io, criminalIP, and internet-measurement are the exceptions).


I don't trust them, they're holding searchable details of whatever they can find by probing open ports on your IP addresses. I don't want that information to be in anyone else's database and neither should you. They also profit from it. Fuck 'em!

# How I Use

I block traffic both to and from these IP address ranges. 

# Observations

Since I learnt of, tracked down, and block-listed a bunch of these organisations, Uninvited Activity on mail-server related ports dropped to almost nothing immediately.

Surprisingly they haven't hit my radar yet, but there may be other blocklists I'm using that already disqualify them.

## Stretchoid.com

The least trustworthy looking website which coincidentally asks you to enter your IP address in order to add it to their 'do not scan' list. Sus. Don't give 'em nothin'.
