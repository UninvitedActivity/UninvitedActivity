# Internet Scanners

These are organisations that appear to scan multiple ports of a fair swag of the IPv4 range.

Most of them have websites that say they provide legit security knowledge and data to governments, researchers, and other organisations. Some of them even allow you to check their findings for specific IP addresses, eg. https://driftnet.io.

I don't trust them, they're holding searchable details of open ports and possibly a fair bit more associated with my IP addresses. I don't want that information to be in anyone else's database and neither should you. They also profit from it. Fuck 'em!

# How I Use

I block traffic both to and from these IP address ranges. 

# Observations

Since I learnt of, tracked down, and block-listed a bunch of these organisations, Uninvited Activity on mail-server related ports dropped to almost nothing immediately.
